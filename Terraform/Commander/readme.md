# Purpose
This is a sample machine with terraform template to demonstrate how to use Chris Long's DetectionLab when you have a paid VMWare vSphere. Before the DetectionLab scripts can run, you need to disable vCenter in the ESXi host. The attached terraform template shows how this can be done automatically.
